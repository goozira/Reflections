What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init sets up a git repository for the current folder.  It is used to keep track of
	all the commits made in the new repository.  It doesn't do any initial commits.  It's 
	just a setup process.  It adds a bunch of git-folders to your directory (./git).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value 
do you think it offers?

	To be honest, I don't really know.  The staging area is sort of a placeholder for files 
	that you want added to your repository.  It is different from the working directory and
	the repository because it is temporary.  I don't know what value it does.
